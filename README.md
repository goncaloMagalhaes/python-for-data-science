2. NumPy basics. Arrays & algebra. Pandas basics.
3. Data loading, cleaning, preparation, wrangling.
4. Plotting, data aggregation. Advanced libs.

## Notes
All course exercises are present in the python files. Because some exercises have the purpose of throwing errors, or waiting for threads to finish, running the entire files can lead to strange behaviours. Furthermore, tools such as sonarlint may emit warnings due to code repetition (this is maintained in the files for students to compare refactors and different phases of a same exercise/feature).

This is aid material for the **teacher** (or students after course), and not an organized list of exercises to be presented *as is* during the course. For course quality, some introductory slides should still be used, as well as creating a fresh repo where the various exercises are presented in an interactive fashion.
